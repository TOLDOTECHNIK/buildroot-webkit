# buildroot-webkit

We were looking for a suitable buildroot system that could launch directly into a full-screen web browser. The original Buildroot offers a ready to compile Qt WebEngine package, but it is much slower in performance than the usual WebKit implementations.
Unfortunately, we couldn't find a solution which was suitable for our purposes.
Compiling some of them was partly faulty, not all boards were supported and the WebKit browser couldn't be started conveniently easy.
After spending a lot of time, we now have made a perfectly running system. We are glad to offer it to the public now.

Many thanks to https://github.com/hlev for supporting us!
Many thanks to all the people who investigated enormous time creating the source code for all the great software!

# Detailed description
Most of the adaptions are stored in the `./board/toldotechnik_rpi/rootfs-overlay` folder. After creating the `sdcard.img` it's content is placed in the root `/` folder.

Two board configurations are available at the moment:
- `toldotechnik_rpi0_wpe_defconfig` for RPi Zero (V1.3) and RPi Zero W (V1.1), both tested

All other RPi 1 boards should work as well.
- `toldotechnik_rpi3_wpe_defconfig` for RPi 3 B (V1.2) and RPi 3 B+, both tested

## Custom settings
Below you will find the explanations of how the customization is made on the final running Raspberry Pi image.  
If you want to apply the settings before building, you can adapt the `board/toldotechnik_rpi/rootfs-overlay` folder. The default URL for the browser is defined in  tthe `board/toldotechnik_rpi/post-image.sh` script.

### URL for the browser
Create a `/boot/url.txt` file and insert the desired link in the first line (e.g. http://localhost).
If the file exists, the browser will start automatically after boot and the url gets loaded in it.

### Full screen video player
Our distro is capable to boot directly into a full screen video player. We use the super fast omxplayer which supports lots of codecs.

To enable video playback follow these steps:
* Put the video file path into `/boot/video.txt` It can be a local path or any url (eg. `/var/video1.mp4`).
* Ensure to delete the `/boot/url.txt` file or its content, so the internal web browser does not get started.

Video gets played in loop mode.

### WiFi configuration
You can modify the sample `/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf.example` file on your SD card and insert your WiFi settings. After that you should rename the file into `wpa_supplicant.conf`

If the file exists at boot time it gets **moved** to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and network should start up immediately. Changes are retained even after restarts. If WiFi credentials are missing, boot times will be much longer.

### Boot splash screen
Our custom company boot splash (see `patches/psplash` folder) is enabled by default. *Please contact us if you want another boot splash logo in a prebuilt image.*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TOLDOTECHNIK/buildroot-webkit/master/_assets/splash-screen.png" width="400" />

We took some existing init scripts and appended the `/usr/bin/psplash-write "PROGRESS x"` command, so the progress bar increases while booting and decreases when shutdown is in progress.

### Node.js server
Node.js binaries and some node modules are preinstalled:
- express
- serve-static
- nodecec

A small Node.js webserver is also included and gets started while booting. It is running on localhost port 80.
Startup script is located here: `/etc/init.d/S30nodeserver`
Local web server content is located here: `/var/www/`

libcec and corresponding node module are both preinstalled so node apps can receive HDMI CEC messages.
See `/var/node/server.js` for an example.

If you need a _real_ web server like Apache or NGINX please refer to https://github.com/TOLDOTECHNIK/buildroot-webkit/issues/13#issuecomment-529283054.

**Builtin local web page supporting CEC and keyboard inputs.**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TOLDOTECHNIK/buildroot-webkit/master/_assets/cec-test.gif" width="400" />

### WPE WebKit browser
If the file `/boot/url.txt` exists the fullscreen browser will start automatically after boot. You will find the corresponding init script here: `/etc/init.d/S90wpe`

You can call the web inspector from an external client browser (tested with Chrome and Safari, not working with Firefox). `http://rpi0.local:9998` or `http://rpi3.local:9998`

If you want do disable it, you can comment out the `export WEBKIT_LEGACY_INSPECTOR_SERVER=0.0.0.0:9998` line in `/usr/bin/wpe`

### Keyboard and mouse input
Attach your keyboard and it's working out of the box. Try it out in the input form control on the sample web page. Please note that the keyboard layout cannot be changed for the WPE WebKit browser yet.

Mouse support in the browser window is enabled by uncommenting the `export WPE_BCMRPI_CURSOR=1` line in `/usr/bin/wpe`

### SSH, serial console
SSH (OpenSSH) is enabled by default. You can ssh into it with `ssh root@rpi0.local` or `ssh root@rpi3.local` SFTP is also supported.

The device will setup a TTY on the UART (ttyAMA0, baud rate: 115200). You can connect to it with an USB serial converter. Ensure to use 3.3V level!

**Console output on ttyAMA0 while booting**

#### Wiring
converter (RX) - green - (TX) RPi

converter (TX) - red - (RX) RPi

Connect GND to GND if you're using different power supplies for the RPi and the serial converter.

### Root password
The root password is `root`

Please change it after first boot: `passwd root`

### Wired network interface
Due to bootup speed improvement eth0 is disabled by default. You can enable it by editing `/etc/network/interfaces`. If it's not working please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/TOLDOTECHNIK/buildroot-webkit/issues/6).

### Auto-expand rootfs on first boot
The `S22resize_rootpart` init script expands the root filesystem to the maximum flash disk size on the first boot.
Firstly it expands the root partition, then a reboot is invoked. After second boot the root filesystem gets expanded to match the partition size. After that the system is ready to use and all the init scripts for expanding the root file system get removed.

### CEC OSD name
You can change the CEC client name in `/boot/config.txt`. Store it in the `cec_osd_name` variable. It will be shown on your screen when selecting the HDMI source.

### Time zone
Currently, the time zone is set to `Europe/Zurich`. You can change this by editing the `/etc/timezone` file. Valid names you can find in the [time zones database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

You also have to link the corresponding zone info file:  
`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/xx/yy /etc/localtime`  
for example:  
`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Alaska /etc/localtime`

## Prebuilt images
Prebuilt images are freely available from our server.
- [RPi Zero / Zero W](https://dev.toldotechnik.li/download/sdcardRPi0.img.zip) (2020-03-14)
- [RPi 2 B](https://dev.toldotechnik.li/download/sdcardRPi2.img.zip) (2020-08-15)
- [RPi 3 B / 3 B+](https://dev.toldotechnik.li/download/sdcardRPi3.img.zip) (2019-06-24)

Image files can be written the same way as the official Raspberry Pi images. Please see https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

If you're using Etcher, you can take the compressed image file without extracting it.

## Known issues (all fixed)
### Node.js
Buildroot compiled Node.js binaries do start much slower than prebuilt ones from nodejs.org
That's why on Raspberry Pi Zero the browser gets loaded before the internal Node.js server is ready. This then results in a blank page screen.
To solve this issue we took the node binary from the prebuilt ones instead: https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.16.0/node-v8.16.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
If you're compiling your own image you can achieve this by creating a sub folder `mkdir -p ./board/toldotechnik_rpi/rootfs-overlay/usr/bin` and copy the `node` binary into it.

### OSX terminal error when using nano
The `Error opening terminal: xterm-256color` we solved by creating the `/usr/share/terminfo/x/` folder and put in the `xterm-256color` database file.

### Raspberry Pis without onboard WiFi
If your board does not have onboard WiFi you can attach some USB Ralink WiFi adapters. We've already included those drivers. RTL8188CUS and RT5370 work for sure.

# How to build it manually

## Prerequisites Ubuntu 16.04
To get the `git` tools working again you have to update them:

    add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa
    apt-get update
    apt-get install git -y

Install the packages:

    apt-get install -y git subversion bc zip build-essential bison flex gettext libncurses5-dev texinfo autoconf automake libtool libpng12-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev gperf libxt-dev ccache mtools libssl-dev

## Prerequisites Ubuntu 18.04
Not fully tested! Seems to have trouble to enable nodejs package...

    apt-get install -y git subversion bc zip build-essential subversion libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk gcc-multilib flex  gettext libssl-dev

    package/e2fsprogs from current buildroot master

## Building
Clone our repo.

    git clone https://github.com/TOLDOTECHNIK/buildroot-webkit.git

Our implementation is based on the WebPlatformForEmbedded/buildroot repository. So let's clone it also. We actually took the master branch commit `b3a832d17fa9bfd8a5b2399cf53d1b8311909e68` as of 2019-01-22.

    git clone https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/buildroot
	cd buildroot
	git reset --hard b3a832d17fa9bfd8a5b2399cf53d1b8311909e68

Add our custom board folder

    cp -r ../buildroot-webkit/board/toldotechnik_rpi ./board/

Then add our custom board configs

    cp ../buildroot-webkit/configs/toldotechnik_rpi0_wpe_defconfig ./configs
    cp ../buildroot-webkit/configs/toldotechnik_rpi2_wpe_defconfig ./configs
    cp ../buildroot-webkit/configs/toldotechnik_rpi3_wpe_defconfig ./configs

The guys from WebPlatformForEmbedded switched over to their mighty tool [WPEFramework](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/WPEFramework) which comes with a lot of [plugins](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/WPEFrameworkPlugins), debugging and so on. For most of the cases the older and simpler to use wpe-launcher for starting up the web browser will be sufficiant.

The current WebPlatformForEmbedded/buildroot master branch does not provide the wpe-launcher anymore, so add it easily with our patch again.

    patch -p1 < ../buildroot-webkit/0001-port-wpelauncher-from-stable.patch

Everything is ready now. You can load your board's configuration by typing

    make toldotechnik_rpi0_wpe_defconfig
or
    make toldotechnik_rpi2_wpe_defconfig
or
    make toldotechnik_rpi3_wpe_defconfig

If you want to make your own changes, run this before compiling.

    make menuconfig

Finally build everything with

    make

After some hours of compiling the final image is ready. You can take it from the output directory: `./output/images/sdcard.img`

Note: At the time of this writing (02/25/2023), the Node.js module `sockt.io` cannot be built automatically. `socket.io` should be disabled in `.config` and copied manually from a precompiled image after the build.
